# Astronomibot
A little Twitch bot I've been working on


Setup:
-------
Create a file called "creds.txt" in the working directory where you're running Astronomibot.  The first line of this file should be the username of your bot.  The second line of the file should be the Twitch oauth key to log in as that user (NOT the password for the account!)
